# Beginner-Programs

##### Programming Language: Java

A large collection of programs, written by me so far, that helped me develop fundamental Java skills.
Mostly contains to solution of exercises from the Java MOOC course: https://moocfi.github.io/courses/2013/programming-part-1/  
Also contains additional programs covering some commonly used and very useful Java APIs and algorithms.  
Practicing to code continuously allowed me to write code more fluently with less error and enhanced my abilty to debug.
